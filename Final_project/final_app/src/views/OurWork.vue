            <h4 class="title"><a href="">Vintage fashion style</a></h4>
            <p class="description">Vintage clothing is all about the old classy looks and exquisiteness. These are fabrics and fashion that came into existence in a bygone era but bygones are not really so bygones. There are people and there is a fashion that comes and goes but the lure of vintage fashion always seems to be timeless.</p>

            <h4 class="title"><a href="">Casual fashion style</a></h4>
            <p class="description">This is more of a formal style and it is better if we term it as business casuals. The casuals are still perfectly fine for a business meeting and office events.</p>
